There are two Skin.ini files included in this skin.

Full Size:
- 1K-8K keymodes use the full size arrows. If you were to fullscreen FNF on a 1080p monitor, this is how the arrows would look.
- 9K and higher keymodes use mini arrows due to space restrictions. Close to default windows resolution FNF arrow size. 

Mini Size:
- All keymodes, 1K-18K, use mini arrows.

There are no other differences between the Skin.ini files.
