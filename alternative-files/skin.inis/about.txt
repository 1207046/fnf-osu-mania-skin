There are eight Skin.ini files included in this skin.

- 1K-8K keymodes use the full size arrows. If you were to fullscreen FNF on a 1080p monitor, this is how the arrows would look.
- 9K and higher keymodes use mini arrows due to space restrictions. Close to default windows resolution FNF arrow size. 

Mini Size:
- All keymodes, 1K-18K, use mini arrows.

Pixel:
- Arrows and numbers are pixellated, in FNF Week 6 style.

Shaggy's Full / Mini / Full Pixel / Mini Pixel:
- Same as above, except note layouts and colour of the !mania notes are changed to be more accurate to the Shaggy mod.
