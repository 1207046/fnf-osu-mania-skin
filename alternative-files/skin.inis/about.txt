There are three Skin.ini files included in this skin.

Full Size:
- 1K-8K keymodes use the full size arrows. If you were to fullscreen FNF on a 1080p monitor, this is how the arrows would look.
- 9K and higher keymodes use mini arrows due to space restrictions. Close to default windows resolution FNF arrow size. 

Mini Size:
- All keymodes, 1K-18K, use mini arrows.

Shaggy's Full Size / Mini Size:
- Same as above, except note layouts and colour of the !mania notes are changed to be more accurate to the Shaggy mod.
- Supports 1K-18K full-size, mini-size, pixel notes and mini pixel notes.

There are no other differences between the Skin.ini files.
